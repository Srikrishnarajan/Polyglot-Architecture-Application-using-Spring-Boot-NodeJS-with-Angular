# Polyglot-Architecture-Application-using-Spring-Boot-NodeJS-with-Angular
Hi, I am Sri Krishnarajan. I have created a basic Deals and Coupons Finder web application using MongoDB, NodeJS, ExpressJS, Java, Spring Boot, Spring Cloud and Angular. This is a case study I have done during my MEAN Stack and Spring Boot Microservices with MongoDB training under Capgemini.
